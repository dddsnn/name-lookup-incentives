- How much reputation is available in query groups?
    - On average? For different percentiles?
    - Impact of decay rate, rewards/penalties, query peer selection?
    - How many queries are successful/failed/timed out?

- How many non-contributing peers (who are content with maximally penalized
  service) can the system tolerate?

- Compare with tit-for-tat.

- How long does it take a new peer to get good reputation in an exisiting,
  stable network?
