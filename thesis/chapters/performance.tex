\chapter{Performance}
- define messages, estimate sizes, id lengths etc.
    - remember signatures for size
    - remember public key for size of a record (or use a separate record to map
      key fingerprint to full key?)
    - remember last changed time (to determine if a received record is very old
      and to give a penalty in that case)
    - remember (possibly?) ttl
    - reputation update regarding responses have to state which ID the query was
      for if peer selection overlap-rep-sorted is used, so that the lowest-rep
      peer can detect that he should have been sent a query
- reputation updates could potentially be batched to save overhead
- compare with tit-for-tat
