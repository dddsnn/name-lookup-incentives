\section{Privacy in Name-Lookup}
- dns-like name-lookup, names to ips in mind, but could have other applications
- dns basically centralized, privacy issue, dns server can profile
- distribute service, make it harder for a single party to profile
- users can decide how far they spread out requests
- not a guaranteed privacy protection, just makes it a lot harder to track
  everyone
- need a lot of servers -> dht, user's should contribute resources
- have no inherent incentive, service still available if they're lazy
- paper "serving dns using p2p lookup" also states "but who's gonna run the
  nodes?"

\section{Necessity}
- why is this even necessary?
- maybe it isn't, best to be prepared
- user bases in other p2p usually small, maybe just the minority that's
  relatively selfless

\section{Outline}

\section{Related Work}
- (computationally) private information retrieval
- peers with utility functions that have a price for privacy
- that paper that found that not all peers to be selfish
- that paper that looked at patterns of collusion
- that paper that found trusting peers initially, based on the trustworthiness
  of recent joiners, is sane
