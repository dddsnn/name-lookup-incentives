\section{TODO}
- wanted to confirm p-grid's resolving IPs while possibly having to look up the
  IP of the peer to send the query to
\section{Future Work}
- going offline
- consider allowing to send a response immediately if it's a "no such peer"
  response, regardless of penalty delay. maybe even for fail responses. would
  speed up queries. those peers should be penalized, but it's not their fault
  the other peer didn't know the answer
