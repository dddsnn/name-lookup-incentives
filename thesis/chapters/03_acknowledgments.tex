\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I'd like to thank my adviser Johannes Krude, who really invested a lot of time
into assisting me with this thesis, helped me diagnose problems with the
simulation, gave feedback on my writing so I wouldn't write long,
incomprehensible sentences like this one and go off on long rants, rambling on
about some meaningless blip of the simulation and its possible causes, while
losing sight of mo--- Squirrel!
