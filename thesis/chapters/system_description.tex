\chapter{Description of the System}
\section{Goal}
- if everyone is selfish but wants to have access to lots of peers, get them to
  contribute
- effective and without negative impacts for cooperating peers
- 4 major areas of interest: reputation availability, mitigating selfishness,
  query group maintenance dynamics, complaints

\section{Organization}
- kademlia/p-grid-style dht
- sync groups for replication/syncing, query groups for descending into the tree
- sync groups maintain records and send each other updates (broadcast here,
  possibly gossipping)
- reputation score is maintained in query groups (each peer stores every
  member's reputation
- peers get reputation for answering queries, penalties for failing to do so (or
  doing so late/early)
- above a threshold, they get delay-free service
- below that, responses to them are delayed
- peers want delay-free service, so they have to participate
- (decay)
- reputation attenuation
- reputation update incentives, here assumed not necessary
- too early responses must also be penalized
- query group formation out of scope
- complaint system if someone misbehaves in non-public interaction, out of scope
- peers can send multiple queries to minimize the risk of a timeout
- peers must send a query to the lowest-reputation peer, but may send more to
  others

\section{Types of Peers}
- cooperating (should refusing to answer count towards this, as the system
  calculates with peers being selfish?)
- defecting out of laziness
- sabotaging, i.e. investing resources to ruin it for others


- something must be done to prevent circular queries: a queries b, b queries c,
  c queries a again, and a awaits the answer from b in order to answer
- assume all sync groups have peers (you can't respond "doesn't exist" for a
  query for an ID in a sync group you're not in. it may be possible to respond
  "probably doesn't exist, with some proof how much work you did, but that's out
  of scope
